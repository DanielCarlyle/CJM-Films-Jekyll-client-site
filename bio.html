            <p>I am a professional film and television editor based in Toronto, Canada. I discovered my passion for filmmaking as a young kid making action movies in my backyard. Later in life I discovered my favourite role, editing. I have since gained important edit room experience working on HBO’s Big Little Lies, The Art of More and Pillars of the Earth. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                A resident of the Canadian Film Centre Cineplex Entertainment Film Editors Lab, I previously completed a BFA in Media Arts and Digital Technology at the Alberta University of the Arts, Calgary, Canada and completed a Graduate Certificate in Advanced Television and Film at Sheridan College, Oakville, Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a freelance editor I have had the opportunity to work in several genres including documentaries, short films, comedy, scripted narrative television  and factual television. I have collaborated on many projects with great directors and show runners telling compelling stories.
            </p>

            <p>
                My editing work has been screened at dozens of film festivals internationally, Including TIFF, FIFA Montreal, DOC LA & has been broadcast on the Discovery Channel, Cooking Channel, History Channel, Netflix, SyFy, CBC, Vice and Sony entertainment. 
            </p>
            <p>I’m a big believer that you are only limited by your imagination, if you can think of it you can make it.</p>
