bio_description: "<p>I am a professional film and television editor based in
  Toronto, Canada. My background is in the fine arts: drawing and painting. I
  explored my passion for filmmaking while attending art school and discovered
  my favorite role was editing. </p><p>As a resident editor at the Canadian Film
  Centre, I had the opportunity to further develop my storytelling skills and
  concentrate on scripted narrative filmmaking. I collaborated with talented
  directors from across Canada making high caliber films, representing diverse
  experiences and voices.</p><p>As a freelance editor I work in several genres,
  including documentaries, short films, comedy, scripted narrative television
  and factual television. I gained important edit room experience working on
  premium projects, including Big Little Lies (Season 2), The Art of More,
  Pillars of the Earth and The Weekend Sailor.</p><p>My editing work has been
  screened at numerous film festivals internationally such as TIFF, FIFA
  Montreal, DOC LA and Madrid International Film Festival and is broadcast on
